I'm a software developer trying to not only make things works, but doing it in the right way. In my opinion, to become lay-off-proof you need to understand things (not only computer things) deeply, I'm not there yet but I'm on track. Currently I'm focused on studying databases, and contributing to Open Source projects. Talk to me about any computer-related stuff (just don't try to make me use Windows). I never get tired :)
